# Diabetes-Incidence

Globally, diabetes has been on the increase due to several factors, may be genetical or environmental factors. In this project we will try and tackle how diabetes has increased in the last decade, and how has it increased compared to population growth for each country. Being a person that suffers from this disease, it interests me how it has been on the increase globally and will showcase this to everyone that has interest on the matter.
