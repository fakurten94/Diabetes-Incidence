# Diabetes-Incidence

Globally, diabetes has been on the increase due to many factors, may be genetical or environmental factors. In this project I tackle how much this disease has increased in the last decade, and how has it increased compared to population growth for each country. Being a person that suffers from this disease, it interests me how it has been on the increase globally and this project showcases this interest.
