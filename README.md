# Diabetes-Incidence

Globally, diabetes has been on the increase due to many factors, may be genetical or environmental factors. In this project I tackle how much this disease has increased in the last decade, and how has it increased compared to population growth for each country. Being a person that suffers from this disease, it interests me how it has been on the increase globally and this project showcases this interest as well as my desire to show my results to everyone.
